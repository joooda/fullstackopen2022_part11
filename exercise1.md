My team works on an application that will be hosted on Microsoft Azure and built with C#. As the software will be hosted on Azure, the natural place for the CI/CD process is to build it on Microsoft's Azure DevOps. Azure DevOps, like GitHub, provides both a git-version control system and cloud-based CI/CD tools with Azure Pipelines. With these tools, the pipeline can be triggered on merges to develop or main branches. In this case, a self-hosted CI setup would be just more hassle.

With Azure Pipelines, the deployment pipeline can be built with YAML files. While linting in C# is less common than in js, linting could be added with dotnet format -tool and automated in the pipeline. Testing is easily added to the pipeline with 'dotnet test' -command, which runs the tests associated with the project. Likewise for build with 'dotnet build'-command. All these can be fairly easily added to the YAML-files (which can also be added to the git version control).

Additionally, we will use Bicep templates to automate the deployment of Azure resources (such as storage accounts, function apps and even SQL databases). The Bicep syntax is simple and easy to integrate to the Azure DevOps pipeline.
